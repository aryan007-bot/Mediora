## 🚫 What We DO NOT Accept

### ❌ **Invalid Contributions:**

1. **No Star = No Valid PR** ⭐
   - If you haven't starred the repo, your PR will be marked invalid

4. **Low-Effort Changes** 😴
   - Copy-pasted code without understanding

5. **Massive Unfocused PRs** 📦
   - Adding 5+ features in one PR

## 📏 Code Standards

### **General Guidelines:**
- Use **functional components** with hooks (no class components)
- Follow existing **code style** and formatting
- Use **meaningful variable names** (descriptive, not `x`, `y`, `temp`)
- Add **JSDoc comments** for complex functions
- Keep functions **small and focused** (single responsibility)

### **React Best Practices:**
```jsx
// ✅ Good - Functional component with clear props
interface SymptomProps {
  symptoms: string[];
  onAnalyze: (symptoms: string[]) => void;
}

export function SymptomList({ symptoms, onAnalyze }: SymptomProps) {
  // Component logic
}

// ❌ Bad - No types, unclear purpose
export default function Component({ data, func }) {
  // Component logic
}
```

### **File Structure:**
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── common/          # Reusable UI components
│   ├── features/        # Feature-specific components
│   └── layout/          # Layout components
├── pages/               # Page components
├── hooks/               # Custom React hooks
├── utils/               # Utility functions
├── lib/                 # External library configurations
└── types/               # TypeScript type definitions
```

### **Commit Message Format:**
```bash
# Use conventional commits
feat: add symptom validation
fix: resolve dark mode contrast issue
docs: update installation instructions
style: format code with prettier
refactor: simplify API call logic
test: add unit tests for analyzer
chore: update dependencies
```

   - Verify mobile responsiveness

3. **Test dark mode:**

4. **Check browser console:**

5. **Test on different browsers:**
   - Chrome/Edge
   - Firefox
   - Safari (if possible)

## 🎨 UI/UX Guidelines

### **Design Principles:**
- **Consistency**: Match existing design patterns
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first approach
- **Performance**: Optimize images and animations

### **Color Palette:**
- Primary: Blue (`#2563eb`)
- Success: Green (`#10b981`)
- Warning: Yellow (`#f59e0b`)
- Error: Red (`#ef4444`)
